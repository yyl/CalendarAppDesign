## Scenarios
#### Name: newMeetingAnnouncedByBoss
----------------
#### Participating actors: 
mike:User, joe:Sharer
#### Flow of events:
- today when mike is at work, his boss, jack, announced a new meeting tomorrow 10 a.m.
- to help himself remember the event, mike creates a new event with his calendar app. He inputs the date, time, location, when to notify and the name of the event, and then saves it.
- joe, a colleague of mike, saw mike create the event. He then ask mike to share this event with him through email. mike opens his phone, type in joe's email address, and then share the event to him. The shared email includes everything but information about notification. 
- the next day, at 9 a.m., mike's phone buzzed. When he pick up the phone, mike realizes the meeting is within one hour, so he starts preparing relevant materials.
